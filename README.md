# utility-wrapper

## Purpose

Encapsulate some common and practical functions or classes.

## Structure

Every directory in ./src is considered a module and must contain an index.ts file.

You do not need to manually write `src/index.ts`; running npm run build will generate it automatically.

## Usage

1. installation

```shell
npm i utility-wrapper
```

2. import

```ts

```

## Development

## Publish

Pushing code to the main branch automatically triggers a git action update to npm
